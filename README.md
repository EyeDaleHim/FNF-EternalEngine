    <h1 align="center">Friday Night Funkin': Eternal Engine</h1>
</p>

Eternal Engine is a [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) engine made from the ground up.
It is meant to be a full rewrite of the 0.2.8 version of the game offering a much cleaner code base while making it moddable and accessible for everyone.
It allows what you except from any other Friday Night Funkin' mod: custom characters, songs, stages and more. While you can mod the source code directly, Eternal Engine features a scripting system allowing you to modify the game in almost any way possible including the menus, all without touching the source code.
In it's current state, Eternal is in alpha and some features such as dialogue is still missing.
